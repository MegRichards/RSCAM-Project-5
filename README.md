# RSCAM-Project-5
The aim of this report is to include a technical review of the 2019 new elliptic PDE solver proposed by Gopal and Trefethen and perform additional simulations or analytical investigations to reinforce the theoretical work in the article. 

Namely, we extend the method to the following elliptic PDEs: 
- exterior Laplace problem 
- transmission Laplace problem
- exterior Helmholtz problem. 

We show that root-exponential convergence remains true for this method when applied to these situations. This is achieved by both numerical experiments and theoretical computations.
